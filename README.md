# Water and Energy in Norway
## Project's Overview

*"Water and energy are linked"* as many authors in different bibliographies affirm. This link is even more "visible" in Norway, where hydropower is the primary energy source in this country (give a value). Therefore, due to my interest in the environmental field and Data Analysis, I created this project, using different Python tools, to show through **interactive plots**:
  1. The water filling capacity of lakes in the five regions of Norway (i.e., Oslo, Kristiansand, Trondheim, TromsÃ¸ and Bergen) over the years; 
  2. The last year's water filling capacity of lakes compared with historical values;
  3. Electricity prices from the current and next day. 
  
## Technologies used

For the select boxes and checkboxes, the Python library **streamlit** was used. For the plotting, the interactive plotting library **plotly** was utilised. Both libraries are open-source Python libraries. To install them, use the following code, respectively:
```
$ pip install streamlit
$ pip install plotly==5.11.0
```

### How to use the project -> Examples

**WATER FILLING CAPACITY PLOTS**

---
Along the code, different functions are used. Depending the graph we want to plot, one or the other should be used:

If the historical values is the data we want to plot

## Lessons learnt

## Future challenges

The following improvements are expected to make:
  1. Include historical values from electricity prices;
  2. Combine filling capacity data with electricity prices and search for correlations;
  3. Observe how climate change has affected, affects and will affect these two studied fields.
