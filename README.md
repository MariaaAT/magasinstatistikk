# Water and Energy in Norway

## Project's Overview

*"Water and energy are linked"* in ways as many authors in different bibliographies affirm. This link is even more "visible" in Norway, where hydropower is the primary energy source in this country (give a value). Therefore, due to my interest in the environmental field and Data Analysis I created this project using the Python libraries StreamLit and plotly to visualise **interactive plots** of:
  1. The water filling capacity of lakes in the five regions of Norway (i.e., Oslo, Kristiansand, Trondheim, Troms√∏ and Bergen) over the years.
  2. The last year's water filling capacity of lakes compared with historical values.
  3. Electricity prices from the current and next day. 

### Data Acquisition

The water filling capacity data was obtained from the [NVE's API](http://api.nve.no/doc/magasinstatistikk/), whereas the energy prices data from the [Hvakosterstrommen API](https://www.hvakosterstrommen.no/strompris-api).
An API key wasn't required to get the values.

## Installation

This runs in any operating system and can be installed via `pip` directly from GitHub.

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/MariaaAT/magasinstatistikk.git
```

When installing StreamLit, pyarrow didn't compile. I installed the precompiled version of StreamLit instead. 

## For developers
### Water Filling Capacity

There are two different functions to plotting in `magasinstatistikk_plotly.py`.

The function `filling_capacity` will plot the water filling capacity from the different regions of Norway over the years.

The function `min_max_plot` will draw the last 52 weeks water filling capacity compared to its historical counterparts.

### Electricity Prices

The function `price_plot` is used and can be found in `electricity_prices.py`

## Lessons learnt

- [x] Data Analysis using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.
- [x] Data Visualization using StreamLit and plotly.
- [x] Transforming data from APIs.

## Future challenges

The following improvements are expected to make:
- [ ] Update hover-label from historical graph.
- [ ] Include historical values from electricity prices.
- [ ] Combine filling capacity data with electricity prices and search for correlations.
- [ ] Observe how climate change has affected, affects and will affect these two studied fields.
