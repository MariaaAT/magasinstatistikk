# Water and Energy in Norway
## Project's Overview

*"Water and energy are linked"* as many authors in different bibliographies affirm. This link is even more "visible" in Norway, where hydropower is the primary energy source in this country (give a value). Therefore, due to my interest in the environmental field and Data Analysis, I created this project, using different Python tools, to show through **interactive plots**:
  1. The filling capacity of lakes in the five regions of Norway (i.e., Oslo, Kristiansand, Trondheim, TromsÃ¸ and Bergen) over the years; 
  2. The last year's filling capacity of lakes compared with historical values;
  3. Electricity prices from the current and next day.

The following improvements are expected to make:
  1. Include historical values from electricity prices;
  2. Combine filling capacity data with electricity prices and search for correlations;
  3. Observe how climate change has affected, affects and will affect these two studied fields.
